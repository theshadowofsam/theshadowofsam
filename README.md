I’m @theshadowofsam -or- Sam Lee

I am a former computer engineering student looking to advance my career into the tech industry,
specifically into the software engineering sector. I am currently trying to learn and forward my
knowledge and experience via certifications and specializations. I have an interest in providing 
solutions for end users and myself in order to ease usage or simply do something nifty.

I enjoy using Python and C++

I also dabble with some basic IT/Networking/Sys-Admin things

I currently maintain **[this](https://github.com/theshadowofsam/discord-bot)** python discord bot.
